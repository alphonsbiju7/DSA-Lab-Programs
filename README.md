📘 DSA-Lab-Programs

This repository contains Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) laboratory programs in C, developed as part of the 3rd Semester BTech CSE (Autonomous Batch) curriculum.

It includes implementations of arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, hashing, and sorting algorithms, all written in clean, modular, and well-commented C code to support easy understanding and revision.

🎯 Skills Demonstrated

Array-Based Operations
Polynomial addition, sparse matrix operations, binary search, sorting algorithms.

Stack Applications
Infix → postfix/prefix conversion and expression evaluation.

Queue Variants
Linear queue, circular queue, deque (double-ended queue).

Linked List Applications
Polynomial addition, web browser navigation, memory allocator simulation.

Tree Operations
Expression tree creation, prefix/postfix generation, BST operations.

Graph Traversal
Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Hashing Techniques
Basic hash table implementation with collision handling.
